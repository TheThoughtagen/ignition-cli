//! CLI definition: the five global args (defined exactly once, here) and the
//! subcommand enum.
//!
//! Placement rules (Phase 1 research, Pattern 1):
//! - Globals set the `global` arg attribute so they propagate to every
//!   subcommand; subcommand structs never redeclare them.
//! - Never mark a global arg `required` (clap rejects required globals).
